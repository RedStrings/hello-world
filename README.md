# hello-world
My first Github repository. 
Zhang Jiahao here! I am a newcomer to the programming world, and I like it very much!(2018 4 18)
It means a not-bad-salary for me,int the real aspect; it is also suitbale for my character.
Above all,the writer I love most called Wang Xiaobo also love the programming, but he died many years ago.
 I want to help him finish the rest of the novels and the codes.
 The programming gives me a lot room and time to live alone, and this feeling makes me comfotbale.
 I want to make friends with you not for learning English but for set up a good relationship.
